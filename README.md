# ChallengeSolutions
My solutions to coding challenges encountered and sought out

This consists of folders for each challenged, arranged hierarchichally in a manner not yet determined. 

At the lowest level, each folder will contain the source code for the challenge, the description of the challenge, and test cases used to verify working code.

At time of writing, it is intended to complete and upload a new challenge daily. We shall see by my commit history how successfull I am at that.
