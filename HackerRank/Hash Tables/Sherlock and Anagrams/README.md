The simplest solution is to brute force it, which is what I've done here. The problem is how it scales - it's O(n^3)

The alternative solution explores a much more efficient path, but was only able to make it O(n^2). I can't think of a more efficient method, which was confirmed by the discussion section on the website itself.
